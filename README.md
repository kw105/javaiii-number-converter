# Number-Systems

Run "java NumberConverter" to launch the program after compilation.

Assuming all input numbers, decimal, hexadecimal, and binary will not exceed the size of an integer.

The program will check the validity of user input before the number conversion.

"Bin to Dec" -- Convert a binary number to a decimal number. Assuming user enters an unsigned binary number. If user input contains the sign (+/-), the unsigned portion of the number will be converted to decimal and the negative sign will be added to the front of the converted decimal number.

"Bin to Hex" -- Convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number. Assuming user enters an unsigned binary number. If user input contains the sign (+/-), the unsigned portion of the number will be converted to decimal and the negative sign will be added to the front of the converted decimal number.

"Dec to Bin" -- Convert a decimal number to a signed binary number (based on twos complement representation). + or - sign at the beginning of the user entered input is allowed to indicate positive or negative number, respectively.

"Dec to Hex" -- Convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number. + or - sign at the beginning of the user entered input is allowed to indicate positive or negative number, respectively. Converted negative hexadecimal numbers will have a leading - sign.

"Hex to Bin" -- Convert a hexadecimal number to a signed binary number (based on twos complement representation). + or - sign at the beginning of the user entered input is allowed to indicate positive or negative number, respectively.

"Hex to Dec" -- Convert a hexadecimal number to a decimal number. + or - sign at the beginning of the user entered input is allowed to indicate positive or negative number, respectively. Converted negative hexadecimal numbers will have a leading - sign.
